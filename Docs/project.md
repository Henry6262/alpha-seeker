# Alpha Seeker: Master Project Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2024-07-11  
**Status:** Finalized for Hackathon MVP

## 1. Project Overview & Vision

Alpha Seeker is a mobile-first, institutional-grade Solana trading intelligence platform designed for the retail trader. It provides users with actionable, real-time data on the market's most profitable wallets, enabling them to discover new opportunities ("alpha") and make informed trading decisions.

Our vision is to democratize access to on-chain analytics, transforming complex data into a simple, intuitive, and indispensable mobile companion for anyone trading on Solana.

### 1.2. Current Implementation Status

**âœ… SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **Backend**: Fastify API server serving real Dune Analytics data (5,063 wallets tracked)
- **Mobile App**: React Native application with fully functional leaderboard interface
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with 3,000+ PNL snapshots and real trading metrics
- **Integration**: Complete end-to-end data flow from Dune Analytics â†’ API â†’ Mobile App
- **Performance**: Top traders showing $128K+ PNL over 7 days with real wallet addresses

### 1.1. Hackathon Winning Strategy

This project is designed to win the Solana Mobile Hackathon by excelling in four key areas:

**Novelty & Impact:** The core "killer feature"â€”paid, customizable push notifications for top trader walletsâ€”provides immediate, actionable utility that doesn't currently exist in a user-friendly mobile format.

**Exceptional UX:** By leveraging React Native and React Native Paper, the app delivers a native, fast, and polished experience, directly addressing the need for high-quality mobile experiences in web3.

**Crypto-Native Business Model:** Integrating Solana Pay for subscriptions demonstrates a seamless, low-friction, and ecosystem-aligned monetization strategy.

**Technical Excellence:** The architecture leverages high-performance tools like Dune Analytics for comprehensive historical analysis and Chainstack's Geyser for planned real-time data, showcasing a robust and scalable backend.

### 1.3. Technology Stack (Current Implementation)

**Frontend:**
- React Native + Expo Router for cross-platform mobile development
- React Native Paper for UI components and theming
- Zustand for state management
- TypeScript for type safety

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Fastify for high-performance API server
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for data persistence
- Dune Analytics API for historical trading data
- Chainstack Yellowstone gRPC (planned for real-time features)

**Infrastructure:**
- RESTful API architecture
- Environment-based configuration
- Automated leaderboard refresh jobs
- Comprehensive health monitoring

## 2. Target Audience

**Primary:** Active retail traders on Solana ("degens") who frequently trade meme coins and new tokens on platforms like pump.fun and Raydium.

**Secondary:** Intermediate crypto investors looking to gain an edge by understanding the behavior of "smart money" on the Solana network.

**Tertiary:** Crypto analysts and researchers who need a quick, mobile way to track on-chain trends.

## 3. Core User Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Our Solution |
|---------|--------------|
| **Information Overload:** It's impossible to track thousands of tokens and wallets manually. | **Curated Leaderboards & Feeds:** We surface the most relevant wallets and trades, cutting through the noise. |
| **Missed Opportunities:** By the time a token is trending on social media, the initial opportunity is gone. | **Real-Time "Gems" Scan & Live Feed:** We show what top traders are buying as it happens, providing a critical time advantage. |
| **Lack of Trust:** It's hard to know which new tokens are legitimate and which are scams. | **Social Proof:** The "Gems" feature shows which top-performing wallets are invested in a token, providing a strong signal of legitimacy. |
| **Reactive vs. Proactive Trading:** Most tools show what has already happened. | **Custom Push Notifications:** Our killer feature allows users to become proactive, receiving alerts based on the actions of wallets they trust, enabling them to act instantly. |

## 4. Detailed Feature Requirements (MVP)

### 4.1. Feature: Leaderboards System âœ… IMPLEMENTED

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance:
- **App Launch Time:** < 2 seconds.
- **API Response Time:** < 200ms (p95).
- **Real-time Feed Latency:** < 1 second from on-chain confirmation to UI update.

### Security:
- Authentication must be handled via wallet message signing (Sign-In with Solana).
