Yes, the live updating leaderboard has been taken into consideration and is a central component of the proposed architecture. The entire data pipeline is designed to be event-driven, ensuring that from the moment a trade occurs on-chain to when the leaderboard updates on the user's screen, the process is as close to real-time as possible.

Here’s a summary of how it works:

Event Ingestion: Our Chainstack Geyser service listens to all transactions from the 200 KOL wallets.

Immediate Processing: When a trade (buy/sell) is detected, our Node.js backend instantly processes it.

PNL Recalculation: The service recalculates the realized and unrealized PNL for the involved wallet.

Database & Cache Update: The new PNL figures are saved to the KolPnlSnapshot table in PostgreSQL, and the live leaderboard rankings are updated in a high-speed cache (like Redis).

Live Push to Frontend: Using Server-Sent Events (SSE), the backend immediately pushes the updated leaderboard data to all connected users.

This ensures the leaderboard is not just a 30-day snapshot but a dynamic ranking that reflects trades and PNL changes the moment they happen.

Technical Implementation Plan: Real-Time Solana KOL Trading Dashboard
This document outlines the technical plan for building a real-time trading dashboard to track 200 Key Opinion Leader (KOL) wallets on the Solana blockchain. We will use Chainstack Yellowstone Geyser for live transaction data, a Node.js backend for processing, PostgreSQL for data storage, and a real-time frontend delivery mechanism.

System Architecture Overview
The architecture is designed for high-throughput, low-latency data processing and delivery. It consists of four main layers:

Data Ingestion (Geyser Service): A persistent gRPC connection to Chainstack Yellowstone streams raw transaction data.

Processing & Enrichment (Node.js Core Service): A Node.js service parses transactions, enriches them with price and metadata, calculates PNL, and persists them to the database.

Data Storage (PostgreSQL & Redis): PostgreSQL stores all historical and calculated data. Redis is used for caching rapidly changing data like live leaderboard rankings.

Data Delivery (API & Real-time Layer): A REST API serves initial data, while Server-Sent Events (SSE) push live updates to the frontend.

(A diagram would be inserted here showing the flow from Geyser -> Node.js -> DB/Redis -> Frontend)

Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Processing
1. Yellowstone Geyser Service (geyser-service.ts)
The core of our real-time data pipeline. This service will establish and maintain a gRPC stream from Yellowstone.

Connection: Use the @triton-one/yellowstone-grpc Node.js client. Implement robust reconnection logic as seen in your provided code, with exponential backoff.

Subscription: Create a SubscribeRequest to filter the stream. This is the most critical step for efficiency. The subscription will be configured with a logical AND of the following filters:

accounts: An object containing the 200 KOL wallet addresses to monitor. This tells Geyser to only send transactions that involve these specific accounts.

programs: An object containing the program IDs of major DEXs on Solana (e.g., Jupiter, Raydium, Orca). This narrows the stream to only include trading-related activities.

Implementation Snippet (subscribeToPrograms):

TypeScript

import { GrpcClient } from '@triton-one/yellowstone-grpc';
import { SubscribeRequest } from '@triton-one/yellowstone-grpc/dist/proto/geyser';

// ... inside your GeyserService class
private async subscribeToKolTrades(): Promise<void> {
  if (!this.client) return;

  const kolAddresses = await this.getKolWalletAddressesFromDb(); // Fetch the 200 wallets
  const dexProgramIds = Object.values(DEX_PROGRAMS);

const subscriptionRequest: SubscribeRequest = {
    accounts: {
      // Filter for transactions involving any of our KOLs
      kol_wallets: { account: kolAddresses }
    },
    programs: {
      // Further filter to only include transactions interacting with known DEXs
      dex_programs: { owner: dexProgramIds }
    },
    // Add other filters as needed, e.g., to exclude failed transactions
    transactions: {
      // Example: 'processed' status, include votes/fails as needed
      status: { processed: true },
      vote: false,
      failed: false,
    }
  };

  const stream = this.client.subscribe(subscriptionRequest);
  // ... handle stream data, errors, and end events
}
2. Transaction Parsing and Normalization
Once a transaction notification is received from Geyser, it needs to be parsed to determine if it was a buy or a sell.

Parsing Library: Use a robust parsing library like @debridge-finance/solana-transaction-parser or a DEX-specific SDK like the @jup-ag/instruction-parser for Jupiter trades. This abstracts away the complexity of decoding instruction data.

Data Extraction: The goal is to extract a normalized "trade" event containing:

kolAddress: The wallet that executed the trade.

inputMintAddress: The address of the token sold.

outputMintAddress: The address of the token bought.

inputAmount: The amount of token sold.

outputAmount: The amount of token bought.

transactionSignature: The unique transaction ID.

blockTime: The timestamp of the trade.

3. Data Enrichment
The raw trade data lacks crucial context. We need to enrich it with price and token information.

Price Fetching: For each trade, immediately call the Jupiter Price API (https://price.jup.ag/v4/price?ids=...) to get the USD value of the tokens at the time of the transaction. This is crucial for accurate PNL calculation.

Token Metadata: Use the Helius Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API (getAsset endpoint) to fetch token metadata (name, symbol, logo URI). This data changes infrequently, so it should be aggressively cached in our Token table to avoid redundant API calls.

Phase 2: Database Schema & Logic
Your existing Prisma schema is very well-structured. The following logic will populate it.

1. Writing to the Database
Upon a successful trade (parsed and enriched):

Create a KolTokenTransfer record: This logs the raw movement of tokens.

Identify Buy vs. Sell: If the KOL received a non-native token (e.g., WIF) and gave SOL, it's a buy. If they gave a non-native token and received SOL, it's a sell.

Update KolPosition:

On Buy:

If no position exists for that token, create one.

Update currentBalanceRaw, totalCostBasisUsd, and weightedAvgCostUsd.

On Sell:

Decrease currentBalanceRaw.

Calculate the Realized PNL for the portion sold using a Weighted Average Cost basis. This is generally preferred over FIFO for simplicity in real-time systems.

Create a KolRealizedPnlEvent to record this profit or loss event.

Update KolPnlSnapshot:

After every trade, recalculate the unrealizedPnlUsd for the affected position by comparing the current market price (from the price feed) with the weightedAvgCostUsd.

Update the realizedPnlUsd, totalPnlUsd, winRate, and totalTrades for that KOL's 30-day snapshot.

Phase 3: Real-Time Frontend & API
1. API Endpoints (Node.js with Express/Fastify)
GET /feed: Returns a paginated list of recent trades for the main "Live Feed".

GET /gems: Returns a paginated list of tokens for the "Gem Finder", aggregated from the GemsFeed table.

GET /leaderboard: Returns the current PNL leaderboard for the last 30 days, initially sourced from the DuneLeaderboardCache and then updated from our live data.

GET /kol/:walletAddress: Returns a detailed view of a single KOL, including their current positions and trade history.

2. Real-Time Updates with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
SSE is more efficient than WebSockets for this one-way server-to-client data flow.

Backend Setup: Use a library like sse-express. Create dedicated SSE endpoints:

/events/feed: Pushes new KolTokenTransfer events as they happen.

/events/leaderboard: Pushes the entire updated leaderboard array whenever a trade causes a rank change.

/events/positions/:walletAddress: A dedicated stream that pushes updates to a specific KOL's positions and PNL when a user is viewing their detailed page.

Frontend Client: The frontend will use the native EventSource API to connect to these endpoints.

Example SSE Logic:

TypeScript

// In your PNL calculation service, after a trade is processed
import { sseManager } from './sseManager';

// ... after saving to DB
const updatedLeaderboard = await getLeaderboardFromCache();
sseManager.broadcastToChannel('leaderboard', updatedLeaderboard);

const newTradeForFeed = getFormattedTradeData();
sseManager.broadcastToChannel('feed', newTradeForFeed);
3. Component Implementation
Live Feed: The main feed component subscribes to /events/feed. When a new event arrives, it animates the new card into the top of the list.

Gem Finder: This component fetches data from the /gems endpoint. Live updates can be less frequent here, perhaps polling every minute or having a separate SSE channel for newly discovered gems.

Live Leaderboard: The leaderboard component fetches initial data from /leaderboard and then subscribites to /events/leaderboard. When a message is received, it re-renders the entire table with the new rankings, highlighting changes. This is more efficient than trying to send deltas for a list that can change significantly.

## **SSE (Server-Sent Events) Implementation**

### **Architecture Overview**
The SSE implementation provides real-time data streaming from backend services to the mobile frontend using a singleton service pattern for optimal connection management.

### **SSE Service Singleton Pattern**
```typescript
// Shared SSE service instance across all backend services
export const sseService = new SSEService()

// Used by:
// - PNL Engine Service (leaderboard updates)
// - Transaction Processor Service (individual transaction/position updates)  
// - Gem Finder Service (gem discovery alerts)
```

### **Connection Management**
```typescript
export interface SSEConnection {
  id: string
  clientId: string
  walletAddress?: string
  channels: string[]
  lastActivity: Date
  isActive: boolean
  reply: any // Fastify reply object for data writing
}
```

### **Channel Structure**
- `leaderboard:{timeframe}` - Real-time leaderboard updates (e.g., `leaderboard:1d`)
- `feed:{walletAddress}` - Individual wallet transaction feeds
- `gems` - New token discovery alerts
- `system` - System status and heartbeat messages

### **Real-time Leaderboard Flow**
1. **PNL Calculations Complete** → PNL Engine Service
2. **Generate Leaderboard Data** → Query latest KOL PNL snapshots
3. **Transform Data** → Format for frontend consumption
4. **Broadcast via SSE** → Send to all connected `leaderboard:{timeframe}` clients
5. **Mobile App Receives** → Update UI in real-time

### **Data Structure - Leaderboard Update**
```typescript
{
  type: 'leaderboard',
  channel: 'leaderboard:1d',
  data: {
    timeframe: '1d',
    leaderboard: [
      {
        rank: 1,
        wallet_address: '5Q544f...',
        curated_name: 'Alpha Trader #2',
        twitter_handle: '@alpha_trader_2',
        total_pnl_usd: 178416606046.9006,
        realized_pnl_usd: 103834408289.8754,
        unrealized_pnl_usd: 74582197757.02528,
        roi_percentage: 189.845,
        win_rate: 99.01,
        total_trades: 26082,
        total_volume_usd: 105443112425.6073,
        snapshot_timestamp: '2025-07-17T20:10:39.095Z'
      },
      // ... 49 more entries
    ],
    timestamp: '2025-07-18T06:16:58.685Z'
  },
  timestamp: new Date()
}
```

### **Mobile SSE Client Implementation**
```typescript
// Event type detection with explicit handlers
this.eventSource.addEventListener('leaderboard', (event) => {
  const messageEvent = event as MessageEvent;
  this.handleMessageWithType(messageEvent, 'leaderboard');
});

// Proper message processing
private handleMessageWithType(event: MessageEvent, eventType: string): void {
  const message: SSEMessage = {
    type: eventType as any,
    data: JSON.parse(event.data),
    timestamp: data.timestamp || new Date().toISOString()
  };
  
  if (this.onMessage) {
    this.onMessage(message);
  }
}
```

### **Performance Characteristics**
- **Latency**: < 1 second from PNL calculation to mobile UI update
- **Connection Management**: Singleton pattern ensures consistent connection pools
- **Data Efficiency**: Complete leaderboard arrays (50 entries) sent on demand
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Heartbeat System**: 30-second heartbeat to detect stale connections

### **Integration Points**
- **PNL Engine**: Triggers leaderboard updates after calculation cycles
- **Transaction Processor**: Sends individual wallet updates for real-time feeds
- **Mobile App**: Receives and processes typed SSE events for UI updates
- **API Routes**: Expose SSE endpoints for client connections (`/api/v1/sse/leaderboard`)
