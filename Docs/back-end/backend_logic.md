Technical Implementation Plan: Real-Time Solana Wallet Tracking Dashboard


Section 1: Executive Summary & Core Architecture


1.1 Project Mandate & Objectives

This document outlines the comprehensive technical implementation plan for a high-performance, live trading dashboard. The system's primary mandate is to track the on-chain activity of 200 specified Solana wallets in real-time. The core objectives are to deliver three key features with maximum resource and cost efficiency: a live transaction feed for each wallet, a "gem finder" service to identify new, high-potential tokens being acquired by these wallets, and a live Profit and Loss (PNL) leaderboard ranking the tracked wallets.

1.2 High-Level System Architecture

The system is designed as a collection of decoupled, microservice-oriented components to ensure scalability, resilience, and maintainability. The architecture is built to handle the high-throughput, low-latency data stream from Solana's Geyser plugin while efficiently processing, enriching, and serving this data to a real-time frontend.
The core components of the system are as follows:
Geyser Ingestor (Node.js Service): This service establishes and maintains persistent gRPC connections to Chainstack's Yellowstone Geyser endpoints. Its sole responsibility is to subscribe to filtered transaction data for the 200 target wallets and push the raw, unprocessed transaction payloads into a message queue.
Message Queue (RabbitMQ or Redis Pub/Sub): Acting as a crucial buffer, the message queue decouples the high-velocity data ingestion from the more computationally intensive processing logic. This prevents backpressure on the gRPC stream and ensures no data is lost during periods of high on-chain activity.1
Transaction Processor (Node.js Service): A pool of worker services consumes raw transaction data from the message queue. These workers parse the transactions to identify specific actions (e.g., swaps, transfers), enrich the data with token metadata and real-time prices from external APIs, and persist the structured information into the PostgreSQL database.
PNL Engine (Node.js Service): This scheduled, event-driven service is responsible for all PNL calculations. It processes completed trades to calculate realized PNL and periodically computes unrealized PNL for all open positions held by the tracked wallets.
API Server (Node.js Service): This service exposes a public-facing API for the frontend application. It provides standard REST endpoints for historical data and leaderboard information, and leverages Server-Sent Events (SSE) for pushing live data feeds to clients.
PostgreSQL Database: The system's primary data store. It houses historical transaction records, parsed swap details, comprehensive token metadata, and calculated PNL figures for each wallet.
Redis Cache: A high-performance, in-memory data store. Its primary function is to power the real-time PNL leaderboard using Redis's Sorted Set data structure, providing instantaneous ranking queries. It may also be used for caching frequently accessed data, such as token prices or metadata.
Frontend (Web Application): The user-facing dashboard, built with a modern JavaScript framework, which consumes data from the API Server's REST and SSE endpoints to render the live feeds and leaderboards.

1.3 Key Technology & Library Selection

The selection of technologies and libraries is driven by the project's requirements for performance, cost-efficiency, and developer productivity. Each component choice is predicated on the capabilities and constraints of the others, forming a cohesive and optimized stack. For instance, the high throughput of Yellowstone gRPC necessitates a non-blocking architecture facilitated by a message queue, an efficient parser like solana-dextrade-parser, and a high-performance database insertion strategy. The unidirectional nature of the dashboard's data flow makes Server-Sent Events (SSE) a more suitable and efficient choice than the more complex WebSockets protocol.2

Section 2: Real-Time Data Ingestion from Yellowstone Geyser


2.1 Chainstack Service Configuration

The foundation of the real-time data pipeline is the Chainstack Yellowstone Geyser service. Proper configuration is paramount for both performance and cost management.
The recommended subscription is the $149/month plan, which provides 5 concurrent gRPC streams and allows up to 50 Solana accounts per stream filter.15 This plan's limitations directly inform the ingestion architecture. To track 200 wallets, it is not feasible to open one stream per wallet; instead, subscriptions must be consolidated. This plan offers unlimited stream events, making it cost-effective for a high-volume application.
To minimize network latency, which can cause data lag and stream instability, the Geyser Ingestor service must be deployed in a cloud region that is geographically co-located with the selected Chainstack gRPC endpoint (e.g., deploying in an Amsterdam-based cloud provider if using grpc.ams.shyft.to).1

2.2 gRPC Client Implementation (@triton-one/yellowstone-grpc)

The Geyser Ingestor service will utilize the @triton-one/yellowstone-grpc Node.js library to connect to the stream.4 The implementation will include a robust connection management wrapper around the client. This wrapper will handle:
Initialization and Authentication: The client will be initialized with the Chainstack endpoint URL and the x-token for authentication, which avoids the need for IP whitelisting and provides greater deployment flexibility.1
Stream Lifecycle Management: The wrapper will manage the lifecycle of the gRPC stream, gracefully handling error and end events. Upon disconnection, it will implement an automatic reconnection strategy with exponential backoff to ensure resilience against transient network issues or provider-side restarts.
Connection Keep-Alive: As documented, some cloud providers and load balancers may terminate idle gRPC streams.16 To prevent this, the client will periodically send a
ping message within the SubscribeRequest. The server sends pings, and the client can simply reply to these to maintain an active connection, ensuring the stream remains open indefinitely.

2.3 Designing the Optimal SubscribeRequest Filter

Crafting the SubscribeRequest is the most critical step for resource efficiency. The goal is to receive only the transactions relevant to the system's function, minimizing bandwidth and processing overhead. The transactions filter is the most appropriate tool for this purpose.
The strategy must accommodate the tracking of 200 wallets within the 5-stream, 50-account-per-filter constraint of the selected Chainstack plan.15 This is achieved by batching the wallet addresses across multiple streams. Furthermore, to power the "Gem Finder," the system must be aware of general DEX activity, which can be monitored via a dedicated stream.
The following configuration details the subscription strategy across the 5 available streams. All subscriptions will use a commitment level of confirmed to balance speed with a reasonable guarantee against state rollbacks.

confirmed
Capture a broad set of swap transactions to aid the Gem Finder in identifying new tokens, which can then be cross-referenced with the tracked wallets' activity.

This multi-stream approach ensures complete coverage of the 200 wallets while staying strictly within the service plan's limits, thus optimizing for cost.

Section 3: Backend Service Architecture: Processing and Persistence


3.1 The Transaction Processing Pipeline

The backend architecture is designed around a pipeline that safely and efficiently processes the high-velocity data stream from the Geyser Ingestor.
A core principle of this design is the decoupling of ingestion and processing via a message queue. The Geyser gRPC stream delivers data at an extremely high rate, and the official documentation warns that a Node.js client can become a performance bottleneck if it attempts too much synchronous work.1 Operations like transaction parsing, database lookups, and external API calls for enrichment are relatively slow. Performing these tasks directly within the gRPC
on('data') event handler would inevitably lead to backpressure, causing the client to fall behind the live stream and potentially resulting in data loss.
To mitigate this, the Geyser Ingestor's only task is to receive the raw SubscribeUpdateTransaction object 3 and immediately publish it to a message queue (e.g., a RabbitMQ topic named
raw_transactions). This action is lightweight and non-blocking, allowing the ingestor to keep pace with the stream. The message queue acts as a durable, elastic buffer, absorbing spikes in on-chain activity and ensuring that every transaction is captured for processing.

3.2 The Transaction Processor Service

This service consists of a pool of concurrent workers that subscribe to the raw_transactions queue. Each worker independently pulls a message, processes it, and acknowledges it upon successful completion. This pattern allows for horizontal scaling; if the queue depth grows, more processor workers can be deployed to increase throughput.
The processing steps for each transaction are:
Transaction Parsing: The raw binary transaction data is not immediately useful.19 The first step is to parse it into a structured, human-readable format. The
solana-dextrade-parser library is the recommended tool for this task.5 Its primary advantage is its built-in support for decoding swap instructions and logs from a variety of major Solana DEX protocols, including Jupiter, Raydium, and Pump.fun. This is essential for accurately identifying the input/output tokens and amounts for the Gem Finder and PNL features without needing to write custom decoders for each protocol.5
Data Enrichment: Once a swap is identified, the processor enriches the data.
It extracts the mint addresses of the input and output tokens.
It queries the local tokens table in PostgreSQL to check if metadata for these mints has already been fetched.
If a token is new to the system, the processor makes a call to the Helius Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API, specifically the getAsset method, to retrieve its metadata (name, symbol, decimals, logo URI).12
This new token metadata is then saved to the tokens table. This caching strategy is critical to minimize external API calls, reducing both latency and cost.

3.3 Database Design and High-Performance Persistence

The PostgreSQL database schema is designed to store the processed data in a normalized and queryable structure.
Schema Design: Key tables include:
tracked_wallets: A static table storing the 200 wallet addresses being monitored.
transactions: Contains core transaction data like signature, timestamp, signer, fee, and status.
swaps: A detailed log of every swap event, linked to a parent transaction. It includes fields for input_mint, output_mint, input_amount, output_amount, and the wallet_address that executed the swap. This table will be heavily indexed on wallet_address and token mints for efficient lookups.
tokens: Serves as the metadata cache for every token encountered. The mint_address is the primary key, with columns for name, symbol, decimals, and logo_uri.
wallet_token_positions: A stateful table tracking the current quantity of each token held by each tracked wallet. This is updated with every buy and sell.
wallet_pnl: Stores the calculated realized and unrealized PNL for each wallet, updated by the PNL Engine.
High-Throughput Insertion: The high volume of incoming transactions would quickly overwhelm a naive insertion strategy using standard ORM methods. A loop of prisma.create() would result in thousands of individual database round-trips, and even prisma.createMany() is suboptimal as it does not return the created records, which can break atomicity if a subsequent read is needed.21
To achieve the required performance, the Transaction Processor will batch processed transactions (e.g., in groups of 100) and use Prisma's raw query interface, prisma.$queryRaw, to execute a single, powerful SQL statement. By leveraging PostgreSQL's INSERT... ON CONFLICT... DO UPDATE syntax, the service can perform an "upsert" operation, inserting new records and updating existing ones efficiently. Appending RETURNING id to this query allows the database to return the primary keys of the affected rows in a single round-trip, ensuring both high performance and data integrity.21

Section 4: Feature Implementation: From Raw Data to Actionable Insights


4.1 Live Transaction Feed

The live transaction feed provides users with an immediate view of the on-chain actions performed by a tracked wallet.
API: The feature is exposed via a Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint: GET /api/v1/feed/{walletAddress}.
Backend Logic: The architecture is push-based. When the Transaction Processor successfully saves a new transaction to the database, it publishes a notification event to a dedicated message queue topic (e.g., feed_updates). This event payload contains the relevant transaction details and the associated wallet address.
SSE Service: A dedicated microservice subscribes to the feed_updates topic. This service maintains a map of active client connections, keyed by wallet address. Upon receiving a new message from the queue, it looks up the corresponding client connection(s) and pushes the transaction data over the open SSE stream.
Technology Choice: This push-based model is vastly more efficient than traditional polling. SSE is chosen over WebSockets because the data flow is strictly unidirectional (server to client). SSE's simplicity, lower overhead, and built-in browser support for automatic reconnection make it the ideal technology for this use case, reducing both server and client-side complexity.2

4.2 The 'Gem Finder' Service

The Gem Finder's purpose is to identify potentially valuable new tokens based on the trading patterns of the tracked "smart money" wallets.
Logic: The core logic resides within the Transaction Processor service.
When a swap transaction is parsed, the service identifies the output token's mint address.
It queries the tokens table. If the mint address is not found, the token is flagged as "newly discovered."
The service then calls the Helius API to fetch the token's metadata and persists it to the tokens table.14
A "gem score" is calculated for this new token. The scoring algorithm is dynamic but can be based on a combination of factors, such as:
The number of distinct tracked wallets that have acquired the token within a short time frame (e.g., 24 hours).
The total trade volume for the token originating from the tracked wallets.
Analysis of initial liquidity, which can be inferred from swap data or queried from DEX-specific APIs.22
Tokens that surpass a predefined score threshold are designated as "gems." This status can be stored in the tokens table or cached in Redis for rapid retrieval.
API: A simple REST endpoint, GET /api/v1/gems, will return a list of current gem tokens, which can be sorted by their score or discovery time for display on the dashboard.

4.3 The PNL Calculation Engine and Leaderboard

This component is responsible for calculating wallet performance and powering the competitive leaderboard.
PNL Calculation Logic: To balance accuracy with implementation feasibility, the system will use the Average Cost Basis accounting method.23 This method calculates the average price paid for a token and uses that to determine profit or loss on a sale.
Realized PNL: This is calculated and recorded every time a "sell" transaction occurs. A "sell" is defined as a swap where a wallet exchanges a token for a base currency like SOL or a stablecoin (e.g., USDC, USDT).
Unrealized PNL: This represents the "paper" profit or loss on current holdings. It is calculated by a scheduled job that runs periodically (e.g., every 60 seconds). For every token position in the wallet_token_positions table, it fetches the current market price from the Jupiter Price API and calculates the potential profit or loss against the average cost basis.11
The precise formulas for PNL calculation are defined below to ensure clarity and accuracy in implementation.

wallet_pnl table.

Leaderboard Architecture (Hybrid Redis/PostgreSQL): A purely database-driven leaderboard that constantly re-queries and sorts 200 wallets by a rapidly changing PNL value would be highly inefficient and fail to scale. The industry-standard solution is a hybrid approach using an in-memory cache.8
After the PNL Engine calculates the Total PNL for each wallet, it persists this data to the wallet_pnl table in PostgreSQL for durability and historical analysis.
Simultaneously, it updates a Redis Sorted Set named leaderboard:pnl.9
The Redis command used is ZADD leaderboard:pnl <total_pnl_value> <wallet_address>. The wallet's PNL is the "score," and the wallet address is the "member." Redis automatically and efficiently maintains the sorted order of all members based on their score.
API: The leaderboard endpoint, GET /api/v1/leaderboard, will query Redis directly using the ZREVRANGE leaderboard:pnl 0 -1 WITHSCORES command. This retrieves the entire sorted list of wallets and their PNL scores with sub-millisecond latency, completely bypassing the slower relational database for this high-frequency read operation.

Section 5: API Layer and Frontend Integration


5.1 API Specification

The API server acts as the single gateway for the frontend application. It exposes a clean, well-defined contract for all required data.
Endpoint
Method
Description
Request Body
Response Body Example
/api/v1/feed/{wallet}
SSE
Streams live, parsed transactions for a specific wallet address.
N/A
A stream of JSON objects, each representing a transaction.
/api/v1/gems
GET
Fetches a list of newly discovered, high-potential tokens identified by the Gem Finder service.
N/A
[{"mint": "...", "name": "...", "symbol": "...", "logo": "...", "score": 95},...]
/api/v1/leaderboard
GET
Returns the current PNL leaderboard, sorted from highest to lowest PNL.
N/A
[{"rank": 1, "wallet": "...", "pnl": 12500.75}, {"rank": 2,...}]
/api/v1/wallet/{wallet}/pnl
GET
Retrieves detailed historical and current PNL data for a single wallet.
N/A
{"realized": 5500, "unrealized": -1200, "total": 4300, "history": [...]}


5.2 Frontend Integration

The frontend application will interact with the backend API to create a dynamic and responsive user experience.
Live Feed Connection: The frontend will use the native browser EventSource API to connect to the SSE endpoint (/api/v1/feed/{walletAddress}). This API is straightforward to implement and handles connection management, including automatic retries on disconnection, by default.10
JavaScript
const walletAddress = '...';
const eventSource = new EventSource(`/api/v1/feed/${walletAddress}`);

eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    const newTransaction = JSON.parse(event.data);
    // Logic to update the UI with the new transaction
};

eventSource.onerror = (err) => {
    console.error("EventSource failed:", err);
};


UI Updates: The leaderboard and gem finder data will be fetched via standard fetch requests to their respective GET endpoints. To keep the data fresh, the frontend will poll these endpoints at a regular interval (e.g., every 15-30 seconds). The UI, built with a framework like React or Vue, should be designed to handle these incoming data updates efficiently, updating only the necessary components to avoid full-page re-renders and ensure a smooth visual experience.

Section 6: Deployment, Monitoring, and Cost Optimization


6.1 Deployment Strategy

A container-based deployment is recommended for flexibility, scalability, and consistency across environments. Each Node.js microservice (Geyser Ingestor, Transaction Processor, PNL Engine, API Server) will be packaged as a separate Docker image. The PostgreSQL and Redis databases will also run in containers.
For initial deployment and development, Docker Compose can be used to orchestrate the multi-container application on a single server. For production, a more robust orchestration platform like Kubernetes (managed via services like Amazon EKS, Google GKE, or DigitalOcean Kubernetes) is advised. This will enable automated scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates for individual services.

6.2 System Monitoring

Continuous monitoring is essential to ensure system health, performance, and reliability. A combination of Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization is the recommended stack.25
Key metrics to monitor include:
Geyser Stream Lag: The delta between the current Solana slot and the slot number received from the gRPC stream. A consistently increasing lag is a critical alert, indicating a problem either with the ingestor service or the upstream provider.1
Message Queue Depth: The number of messages in the raw_transactions queue. A persistently high or growing number indicates that the Transaction Processors are unable to keep up with the ingestion rate, and more workers may need to be deployed.
Database Performance: Latency on key database queries, particularly the batch inserts and the PNL calculation queries. High latency could signal a need for query optimization or database scaling.
API Latency and Error Rates: Standard application performance monitoring (APM) for all public API endpoints to ensure a responsive user experience.

6.3 Cost Optimization Summary

The architecture is fundamentally designed for cost-efficiency through several key strategies:
Efficient Data Ingestion: The gRPC subscription strategy is carefully designed to track 200 wallets using the minimal number of streams required, fitting within the cost-effective base plan from Chainstack.15
Intelligent Caching: Caching token metadata in PostgreSQL and the live leaderboard in Redis drastically reduces the number of calls to paid, third-party APIs (like Helius and Jupiter) and offloads the primary database from high-frequency read requests.
Decoupled, Scalable Architecture: The microservice design allows for targeted scaling. If transaction processing becomes a bottleneck, only the Transaction Processor component needs to be scaled up, rather than over-provisioning the entire application stack.
Cloud-Native Deployment: Leveraging pay-as-you-go cloud services and auto-scaling features ensures that computational resources align with actual demand, preventing payment for idle capacity.26
